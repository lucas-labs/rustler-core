## Why "rustler"

A `rustler` is a person who steals live**_stock_**. Well, this library is a service that collects _stock_ market data from the internet. So, it's a "_rustler_" for stock market data.

Also, this library is built using the `Rust` programming language... so, **_rust_**ler 😊

## What this library includes

See [here](./lib/rustlers/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> This library defines a _rustler_ as a service that scrapes stock pricing data for a particular 
> market.
>
> Although this library contains the core and abstract functionality for the rustlers, it doesn't
> include any concrete implementation for them.
>
> Actual concrete implementations for each market cannot be published for many reasons.
